# bikesharing

A bikesharing business is being considered in Des Moines, IA. Using NYC Citi bike data and tourism attractions, it is being determined whether having a bikesharing business would be profitable in Des Moines.<br />

Data Sources: Citi Bike August 2019, McDonald's locations in NY and IA, QuickFacts Des Moines, IA Census, QuickFacts New York, NY Census, Google Maps<br />

Software: Tableau<br />

### Population (Figure 1)
This chart displays the Gender breakdown for CitiBike usage in NYC, a total of 2,344,224 and CitiBike customers (443,865). We also look at the population and gender make up between both cities.
Altogether, 28% of people in NYC use CitiBike (38% of Males and 13% of Females). While the population for NYC is significantly higher than Des Moines, more information will be needed about the cities to determine whether a bikesharing business in Des Moines will be a good decision.

### Top Starting and Ending Locations (Figure 2)
For research purposes, we understand the top starting and ending locations for CitiBike in NYC based on the heat map below. We will need to consider if Des Moines will have a similar outcome based on local activities and tourist attractions. The assumption is that if Des Moines is becoming a popular city and has tourist attractions, it is likely that locals and visitors will also have a significant number of starting and ending locations.

### Average Trip Duration by Gender in NYC (Figure 3)
Another consideration is to understand the demand of bike riding in Des Moines. As you see in NYC, duration of bike riding has increased in both males and females between the birth years 1995 and 2000. This will help understand the demand of bike riding in Des Moines and determine where bike stations should be placed.

### NYC August Peak Hours (Figure 4)
We decided to look at the summer (August 2019) peak riding hours in NYC and determined that it was between 5pm-7pm. The second highest was between 7-8am. This is another data point to consider for commuters, visiting professionals, locals and tourists in Des Moines.

### NYC McDonalds and Landmarks Map (Figure 5)
We want to determine where we are going to place bike stations and consider tourists as our main customer. We decide to compare a sample of NYC landmarks and McDonalds downtown. Although the landmarks are spread apart, we find that there is a nearby McDonalds for each one to place bike stations.

### McDonalds and Des Moines Landmarks Map (Figure 6)
We notice that the Des Moines landmarks are much closer to each other than they are in New York. We will need to understand the tourism in Des Moines better but access to a bike stations wonâ€™t be a problem.
